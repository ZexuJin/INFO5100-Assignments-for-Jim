    /*  Explain Encapsulation with an example. (Write at least 30-40 words).  */

    /*
    * Encapsulation is a process of wrapping the data and the code, that operate on the data into a single entity.
    * You can assume that the data or functions are hidden from the customers (other classes or functions) for security reasons.
    * In other words, it helps protect the data from being accessed from code outside this class.
    * For example, there's a system that contains important information (ID, salaries, dateofbirth, banking account...) of all its employees in a company.
    * Using encapsulation can prevent others from accessing those important data, which might leave huge impact on the company's operation once leaked.
    * Using encapsulation also makes it easy to manage those data when there's updates.
    * */


    /*  Q10  */
    /*  What is the difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction.  */

    /*
    * Encapsulation solve problems in implementation stage.
    * It focuses on methods to hide the codes and data into one unit to secure the data from the outside world.
    *
    * Abstraction solve problems in design stage.
    * It focuses on what kind of data/information that we want to implement.
    * It generally retains only information which is most relevant for that specific process.
    * Abstraction method focuses on the idea instead of actual functioning.
